## [Python Pipenv](/python-pipenv)

This image is intended to be used as a base for our Python services and tools, having `pipenv` and other required build
time dependencies such as `gcc` built in.

Currently, we maintain it for these python versions:

- 3.11
- 3.12

To update the python base versions, update the relevant `python-3.x-tag.txt` file, ensuring you use the `slim` image and
pin it to the SHA digest explicitly.

Build the latest version with:

```shell
make python-pipenv
```

Or build a specific version with `make python-pipenv-3.x`, e.g.:

```shell
make python-pipenv-3.10
```

## [Cloud SDK Terraform](/cloud-sdk-terraform)

A cloud SDK based image with TFenv and a Terraform version pre installed.

Build with

```shell
make cloud-sdk-terraform
